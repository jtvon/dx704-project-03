The UCB algorithm is more suitable for this problem because it balances exploration and exploitation effectively. It is more likely to identify the best arm quickly compared to other algorithms like epsilon-greedy or Thompson Sampling.
Epsilon-greedy may waste too many trials on exploration, while Thompson Sampling can be computationally intensive and may not perform as well in scenarios with a small number of arms or limited trials.
