The Epsilon Greedy is more suitable for this problem because it balances exploration and exploitation effectively, allowing the agent to discover the best arm while still leveraging known information to maximize rewards.The UCB algorithm may not perform well as it requires more initial exploration to find the optimal arm.The Thompson Sampling Approach can be computationally intensive although this dataset is small, with the environment allowing multiple possible rewards, it may not fit well.
